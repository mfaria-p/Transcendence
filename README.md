  <!-- What is a Framework? For this project, a framework is defined as a
comprehensive tool that provides:
• A structured architecture and conventions for organizing code.
• Built-in features for common tasks (routing, state management,
etc.).
• A complete ecosystem of tools and libraries.
Examples:
• Frontend frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js
(these are frameworks).
• Backend frameworks: Express, Fastify, NestJS, Django, Flask,
Ruby on Rails.
• Not frameworks: jQuery (library), Lodash (utility library),
Axios (HTTP client).
Note: React is considered a framework in this context due to its
ecosystem and architectural patterns, even though it is technically a
library
